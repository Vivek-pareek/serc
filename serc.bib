abstract = {An aspect-oriented design model consists of a set of aspect models and a primary model. Each aspect model describes a feature that crosscuts elements in the primary model. Aspect and primary models are composed to obtain an integrated design view. In this paper we describe a composition approach that utilizes a merging algorithm and composition directives. Composition directives are used when the default merging algorithm is known or expected to yield incorrect models. Our prototype tool supports default class diagram composition.},

abstract = {Access control features are often spread across and tangled with other functionality in a design. This makes modifying and replacing these features in a design difficult. Aspect-oriented modeling (AOM) techniques can be used to support separation of access control concerns from other application design concerns. Using an AOM approach, access control features are described by aspect models and other application features are described by a primary model. Composition of aspect and primary models yields a design model in which access control features are integrated with other application features. In this paper, we present, through an example, an AOM approach that supports verifiable composition of behaviors described in access control aspect models and primary models. Given an aspect model, a primary model, and a specified property, the composition technique produces proof obligations as the behavioral descriptions in the aspect and primary models are composed. One has to discharge the proof obligations to establish that the composed model has the specified property.},

abstract = { In a majority of Indian Engineering colleges, Software Engineering tends to be considered as a theoretical course. More specifically, software design is taught using traditional lecture based teaching methods with minimal hands-on experience on working with team based projects. As part of this paper, we share our experiences in teaching code smells and design patterns using project-based learning approach to students in a Software Engineering course. We tracked students’ ability to detect code smells and codify design patterns through code evaluation. A confidence survey conducted at the end of the course had a positive feedback. We believe the approach can be repeated across engineering colleges in India to teach Software Engineering design.},

abstract="The explosive growth of internet users and connected devices increased the threat vector surface. However, there is no single website or a search engine that provides information on vulnerabilities, threats, attacks, controls, etc. Ambiguity, bias and lack of credibility are some of the alarming issues while dealing with generic search engines on sensitive topics such as `Health' and `Information Security'. A dedicated information security specific search engine benefits various stakeholders including security professionals, researchers, government, regulators and others. We implemented a fine grained approach that identifies sub-domains of information security, extracts related URLs and content and assesses search results credibility to enhance adoption of information security specific search engine.",

In this report, we brie y summarize the key insights from 1st Software Engineering Research in India Update Meeting (SERI 2019), which provides a platform for all the researchers to present and discuss their research work. The essence of this research meeting is to examine the current research areas within the software engineering research community and discover the scope of collaboration. Speci cally, the rst SERI update meeting had a series of invited research talks presented by researchers from academia and industry representing various software engineering labs across India. These talks unveiled notable views through presentations and group discussions, and cogitation of topics that can lead to fruitful collaborations between software engineering researchers and industry practitioners. The main objective of this update meeting is the exchange of research areas that promotes successful short-term and long-term collaborations.},

abstract="Software quality has always been an important criterion for assessing stability of a product. It is quite challenging for large-scale complex products, especially integrated products, to endure and withstand the competition after a new version release in its market domain. Unlike regular software, integrated software products require detailed exploration on the spread and impact of a defect to improve overall product quality. In this paper, we use heuristic approaches like generalized defect dependency approach, control flow graph based approach, and feature correlation based approach to study the widespread of defects in large software and suggest a metric called defect dependency metric to study the dependency of defects. We implemented the generalized defect dependency approach on an industry dataset and gathered noteworthy results. We provide a comparative a study of the heuristic approaches and comprehended their individual usage with observations. We further discuss the need of adoption of such vision in industries as a standard testing practice to improve quality.",

abstract = {Aspect oriented programming (AOP) is a programming paradigm that provides mechanisms for encapsulating cross-cutting concerns. Developers who want to learn AOP often experiment with aspects and different Pointcuts on their existing code bases to try and incorporate aspects into their software project. This typically involves an iterative process of testing multiple Pointcuts, partially due to the new syntax the developer has to learn, as well as to try and find the aspectual implementation that best fits their needs. Incremental weaving time is a huge factor in making this process smooth and faster for developers to more readily learn and adopt AOP. We propose an optimization approach that focuses on reducing redundant re-compilations and weaving. We propose that the approach can reduce the time being spent for weaving and thereby facilitating faster iterative project build time. We have done some initial studies on a couple of code bases which yield build times that are up to five times faster than the traditional build, while keeping overheads and worst case build time close to normal build times.},
